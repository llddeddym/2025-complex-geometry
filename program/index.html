                The moduli space of stable Higgs bundles of 
                degree \(0\) is equipped with the hyperkähler 
                metric, called the Hitchin metric. On the locus 
                where the Hitchin fibration is smooth, there is 
                the hyperkähler metric called the semi-flat 
                metric, associated with the algebraic integrable 
                systems with the Hitchin section. As predicted 
                by Gaiotto, Moore and Neitzke, the difference 
                between the metrics along the curve \((E,t\theta)\) 
                decays in an exponential way. In this talk, we shall 
                discuss how to improve the exponential rate in the 
                rank \(2\) case.

                In 1987, Hitchin constructed a complete hyperkähler 
                metric on the moduli space of Higgs bundles, which 
                can be generalized to accommodate singularities. In 
                this talk, we consider Higgs bundles with irregular 
                singularities over the Riemann sphere. We construct 
                a generic ray in the moduli space and study the 
                asymptotic behavior of the Hitchin metric along this 
                ray. Using the techniques developed by Biquard-Boalch, 
                Fredrickson-Mazzeo-Swoboda-Weiss, and Mochizuki, we 
                show that the Hitchin metric is exponentially close 
                to a simpler semi-flat metric. In dimension four, we 
                obtain an explicit asymptotic formula for the semi-flat 
                metric, which is of type ALG or ALG*. This is a joint 
                work with Nianzi Li.

                Rank one symmetric differentials, a concept introduced 
                by Taubes, play a significant role in gauge theory and 
                differential geometry. In this talk, we&rsquo;ll dive into 
                the world of rank one symmetric differentials over projective 
                varieties. We&rsquo;ll explore how rank one symmetric 
                differentials are connected to Higgs bundle and a recent 
                proposal by Chen-Ngo. Furthermore, we will explain how rank 
                one symmetric differentials could play a role in the Simpson 
                integral conjecture. We will discuss a new proof using Finsler 
                metric rigidity to prove characteristic rigidity and 
                integrality for arithematic varieties with rank bigger than

                tt*-geometry structure was found by physicists 
                in the 1980&rsquo;s, and defined and developed 
                later in mathematics at the beginning of 90&rsquo;s. 
                It is an integrable structure mixed with the 
                holomorphic and anti-holomorphic parts, and has close 
                connections with Higgs bundles, Frobenius manifolds 
                and other interesting structures. It is believed that 
                it can be applied to more important occasions. The tt* 
                geometrical structures of Calabi-Yau manifolds have 
                been built long ago in the name of “special geometry”. 
                In this talk, I will explain my construction of

                on the Cartan subalgebra. In studying the Hitchin morphism of 
                principal \(G\)-Higgs bundles over higher dimensional varieties, 
                Chen and Ngo conjectured a multi-variable generalization of the 
                Chevalley restriction theorem, and they proved the \(\mathrm{GL}\) 
                and \(\mathrm{Sp}\) cases. We then prove the orthogonal group case 
                and our treatment can apply to the \(\mathrm{GL}\) and \(\mathrm{Sp}\) 
                cases in a uniform way. In this talk I will explain the main ideas 
                of the proof and the backgrounds from Hitchin morphism and algebraic 
                invariant theory. This is a joint work with Lei Song and Xiaopeng Xia.

                The non-abelian Hodge correspondence was established by 
                Corlette-Donaldson-Hitchin-Simpson, it states that, on a 
                compact Kähler manifold, there is a one-to-one correspondence 
                between the moduli space of semisimple flat complex vector

                In this talk, we will consider the Monge-Ampère fibration, 
                a relative Kähler fibration that satisfies a homogenous 
                Monge-Ampère equation. There are two generalized Weil-Petersson 
                metrics on its base manifold. For one metric, we present a 
                specific curvature formula, demonstrating its non-positive 
                holomorphic bisectional curvature, along with several other 
                curvatures capped negatively. We'll also prove the conditions 
                under which a holomorphic vector bundle over a compact Kähler 
                manifold corresponds to this Monge-Ampère fibration. Furthermore, 
                we link relative Kähler fibrations to Higgs-flatness of 
                associated infinite rank Higgs bundles. We conclude by highlighting 
                classical Monge-Ampère fibration examples. This work is joint with

                The non-abelian Hodge correspondence is a real analytic map between 
                the moduli space of stable Higgs bundles and the deRham moduli space 
                of irreducible flat connections mediated by solutions of the 
                self-duality equation. In my talk I will explain how to construct 
                such solutions for strongly parabolic \(\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})\) 
                Higgs fields on a \(4\)-punctured sphere with parabolic weights \(t\sim 0\) 
                using loop groups methods through an implicit function theorem 
                argument. The methods and computations are based on Deligne&rsquo;s 
                interpretion of the twistor space via \(\lambda\)-connections. As a 
                first application of this approach, I identify the rescaled limit 
                hyper-Kähler moduli space at \(t = 0\) as the Eguchi-Hanson space, 
                and I show that the hyper-Kähler metric can be expanded to arbitrary 
                order in terms of multiple-polylogarithms. Finally, the geometric 
                properties lead to some identities involving multiple-polylogarithms. 
                This talk is based on joint work with Sebastian Heller and 
                Martin Traizet.

                Given a Riemann surface, the non-Abelian Hodge theory roughly speaking 
                builds a correspondence between Higgs bundles and harmonic maps. In 
                this talk, under the background of the moduli space of the Higgs 
                bundles, we discuss some estimates of the geometric quantities from 
                harmonic maps. We focus on two kinds of estimates: domination and 
                boundedness. We will also show some applications of the estimates. 
                The main results in this talk are joint with Qiongling Li.
